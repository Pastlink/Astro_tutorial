    <h2>Who am I</h2>
    <p>
      For reasons that should be obvious to anyone on the Internet, I'm not
      giving my real name, but I've used the '{identity.firstName}' nickname for
      so long that you might as well call me that. I'm a {
        identity.occupation[1]
      }, although I just call myself a {identity.occupation[0]} since I studied more
      on my own before going to university that I barely learnt anything new that
      wasn't specifically about businesses. In any case, I don't really see myself
      as one, it was a hobby to learn Psychology and I'm more interested in research
      than whatever an IO Psychologist should do. I like to learn new things, that's
      why I have a hard time getting good at one thing fast, but I'll be worth it
      in the long run, I'm sure. I'm bilingual, Spanish and English. And although
      I'm fluent in both, don't ask me technical questions in Spanish, most of my
      knowledge was and is being acquired in English and I just don't know the words
      in Spanish for most things. I'm also learning other languages, first one is
      Japanese, to the surprise of few, I'll say I'm intermediate, I'm quite comfortable
      listening, kind of struggle with reading but getting better, though I haven't
      tried to output at all, so no speaking. The other one is French, which I didn't
      think I would like, but here I am, also hittitng the intermediate level in
      input, again, no output at all. I enjoy using <a

        target="_blank">Linux</a
      > for most things, but right now I try to separate my studies and work from
      entertaiment, like videogames, movies, anime, etc. between the two OSes, Linux
      and Windows. Right now I'm learning Web Development and since I have a background
      in Psychology I want to learn more about programming to try to get closer to
      my dream of being a Neuroscientist.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]}, {identity.hobbies[1]},
      {identity.hobbies[2]}, {identity.hobbies[3]}.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>TL;DR</strong> I'm a Psychologist, Language Enthusiast, Linux Enthusiast,
      Web Developer and I aspire to become a Neuroscientist one day.
    </p>

    <p>My current skills are:</p>
    <ul>
      {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
    </ul>

    <h3>What I do</h3>
    <p>I'm learning...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Math <em>(at which I'm getting better at!)</em></li>
      <li>Web Development</li>
      <li>Computer Science</li>
      <li>Foreign languages</li>
      <li>More Psychology</li>
      <li>How to be a better, overall healthier person!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I work on...</p>
    <p>
      For now I'm just learning things and enjoying my hobbies, in a few weeks
      or months I might become an English teacher, but that's still a maybe.
      <br />

    <h3>My languages</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Spanish: Native</li>
      <li>English: Naturalized*</li>
      <li>Japanese: Intermediate</li>
      <li>French: Low intermediate</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      * By Naturalized I mean that I've used the language for so long and for so
      many things that it is just second nature to me. I'm not a native,
      <br />but the difference is pretty negligible.
