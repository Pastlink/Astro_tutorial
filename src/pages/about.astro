    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>Who am I</h2>
    <p>
      For reasons that should be obvious to anyone on the Internet, I'm not
      giving my real name, but I've used the 'PastLink' nickname for so long
      <br />that you might as well call me that. I'm a Organizational
      Psychologist, although I just call myself a Psychologist since I studied
      more
      <br />on my own before going to university that I barely learnt anything
      new that wasn't specifically about businesses. In any case, I don't
      <br />really see myself as one, it was a hobby to learn Psychology and I'm
      more interested in research than whatever an IO Psychologist should do.
      <br />I like to learn new things, that's why I have a hard time getting
      good at one thing fast, but I'll be worth it in the long run, I'm sure.
      <br />I'm bilingual, Spanish and English. And although I'm fluent in both,
      don't ask me technical questions in Spanish, most of my knowledge was
      <br />and is being acquired in English and I just don't know the words in
      Spanish for most things. I'm also learning other languages, first one is
      <br />Japanese, to the surprise of few, I'll say I'm intermediate, I'm
      quite comfortable listening, kind of struggle with reading but getting
      better,
      <br />though I haven't tried to output at all, so no speaking, the other
      one is French, which I didn't think I would like, but here I am, also
      hittitng
      <br />the intermediate level in input, again, no output at all. I enjoy
      using <a

        target="_blank">Linux</a
      > for most things, but right now I try to separate my hobbies/work
      <br />and entertaiment, like games/movies/anime/etc. between the two OSes,
      Linux and Windows. Right now I'm learning Web Development and
      <br />since I have a background in Psychology I want to learn more about
      programming to try to get closer to my dream of being a Neuroscientist.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>TL;DR</strong> I'm a Psychologist, Language Enthusiast, Linux Enthusiast,
      Web Developer and I aspire to become a Neuroscientist one day.

    <h3>What I do</h3>
    <p>I'm learning...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Math <em>(at which I'm getting better at!)</em></li>
      <li>Web Development</li>
      <li>Computer Science</li>
      <li>Foreign languages</li>
      <li>More Psychology</li>
      <li>How to be a better, overall healthier person!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What I work on</h3>
    <p>
      For now I'm just learning things and enjoying my hobbies, in a few weeks
      or months I might become an English teacher, but that's still a maybe.
      <br />
    </p>
    <h3>My languages</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Spanish: Native</li>
      <li>English: Naturalized*</li>
      <li>Japanese: Intermediate</li>
      <li>French: Low intermediate</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      * By Naturalized I mean that I've used the language for so long and for so
      many things that it is just second nature to me. I'm not a native,
      <br />but the difference is pretty negligible.
